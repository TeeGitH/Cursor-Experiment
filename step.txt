## Checkpoint Verification Process
At each checkpoint:
1. Verify functionality works as expected
2. Check for any errors or issues
3. Make necessary adjustments before proceeding
4. Document learnings and challenges

## Note
This plan is flexible and can be adjusted as the project progresses. Each checkpoint represents a working state where we can pause, evaluate, and ensure the implementation is solid before moving forward.
