Project Summary: LINE Chatbot Powered by OpenAI API (Running on Local Laptop)

üéØ Goal
Create a LINE chatbot that communicates with users (1-on-1 or in group chats) via the LINE Messaging API, processes user messages using OpenAI Assistant API, and runs the entire backend on a local laptop server using Python.

üß© Key Components

- Platform: LINE Application
- Users: Individuals or groups interacting with the chatbot

2. Middleware
- LINE Messaging API
  - Receives incoming messages
  - Sends responses back to users
  - Forwards events to your server via Webhook (HTTPS required)

3. Backend (Local Server)
- Language: Python
- Framework: functions-framework
- Server: Runs on your own laptop
- Tunnel Tool: ngrok used to expose localhost to the internet via public HTTPS

4. AI Engine
- OpenAI API


üîÑ End-to-End Workflow

1. User sends a message to your LINE bot.
2. LINE Messaging API triggers a webhook to your laptop server.
3. Your server receives the event and extracts the message.
