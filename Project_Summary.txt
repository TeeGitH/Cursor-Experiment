Project Summary: LINE Chatbot Powered by OpenAI API (Running on Local Laptop)

üéØ Goal
Create a LINE chatbot that communicates with users (1-on-1 or in group chats) via the LINE Messaging API, processes user messages using OpenAI API, and runs the entire backend on a local laptop server using Python.

üß© Key Components

1. Frontend (User Interface)
- Platform: LINE Application
- Users: Individuals or groups interacting with the chatbot

2. Middleware
- LINE Messaging API
  - Receives incoming messages
  - Sends responses back to users
  - Forwards events to your server via Webhook (HTTPS required)

3. Backend (Local Server)
- Language: Python
- Framework: FastAPI
- Server: Uvicorn ASGI server
- Tunnel Tool: ngrok used to expose localhost to the internet via public HTTPS
- Future Deployment Options: Vercel or Heroku

4. AI Engine
- Phase 1: OpenAI Chat Completions API
- Phase 2 (Future): OpenAI Assistants API

üîÑ End-to-End Workflow

1. User sends a message to your LINE bot.
2. LINE Messaging API triggers a webhook to your laptop server.
3. Your server receives the event and extracts the message.
4. The message is passed to the OpenAI API.
5. OpenAI replies.
6. Your server sends response back to the user via LINE Messaging API.

üîç Implementation Approach

Phase 1: Basic Setup with Chat Completions API
- Set up FastAPI and LINE webhook handler
- Implement basic conversation using OpenAI's Chat Completions API
- Focus on reliability and proper error handling

Phase 2: Enhanced Features (After Phase 1 is stable)
- Potentially upgrade to OpenAI Assistants API for persistent context
- Add rich message features (buttons, carousel, etc.)
- Implement user management and conversation history

üõ†Ô∏è Milestones

- ‚úÖ Create LINE Official Account and Messaging API channel
